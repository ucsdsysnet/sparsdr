This application decompresses IQZip/SparSDR compressed files. It can be used offline with regular files for input
and output, or in real-time using standard input/standard output or named pipes.

By default, the application assumes that the compressed file was recorded with 100 Mhz of bandwidth. It decompresses
the full signal using an inverse FFT of size 2048.

There are two supported methods to decompress a smaller range of frequencies.

Method 1: Specify a non-zero center frequency and a number of bins less than 2048. The bins around the center frequency
will be decompressed.

Method 2: Specify one or more decompression bands. If method 2 is used, the center frequency, bins, and destination
arguments must not be provided.
